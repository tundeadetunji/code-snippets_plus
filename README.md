# Snippets Plus


<br>

<p>Remembering commands is one thing, lengthy commands/scripts is another. I decided to make a small app with which you can store structured scripts/commands snippets in JSON format, and it simply loads it on demand. It's a desktop app that runs on Windows PC.</p>

<p>You can rebuild it (Desktop application, requires Installer Projects extension in Visual Studio) to generate an installer.</p>
